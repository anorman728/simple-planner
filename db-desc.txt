Since there are no column comments in SQLite, I'm putting descriptions in this file.

meta -- Contains metadata, such as version number, etc.
    name (text not null)   -- Name of field.
    desc (text not null)   -- Description of field.
    value (text not null)  -- Value of field.

items -- Contains all planner items.
    id (integer primary key autoincrement)
    date (int)            -- The date, as integer (convertible by
                             date-functions).
    desc (text)           -- The description.
    rep (int not null)    -- Repetition type, defined by planner-functions.h

TODO: done_items -- Contains all days on which an item should be marked as done/completed.
