Since there are no column comments in SQLite, I'm putting descriptions in this file.

meta -- Contains metadata, such as version number, etc.
    name (text not null) -- Name of field.
    desc (text not null) -- Description of field.
    value (text not null) -- Value of field.

items -- Contains all planner items.
    id (integer primary key autoincrement)
    date (integer not null) -- Date that the item takes place.  In the database, the format is number of days since Jan 1, 2000.
    desc (text) -- The description.
    rep (integer not null) -- Repetition, matching an enum value in planner-functions.h.
    exp (integer not null) -- Date that the item expires.  In the database, the format is the number of days since Jan 1, 2000.  Set to zero if no expiration.
    done (integer not null) -- "Done" status.  0 if needs to be done, 1 if already done, -1 if not applicable.
