# Simple Planner

Every calendar software that I've ever used, ever, has been terrible.  Not just recent ones, but when I was using Palm OS and even those digital organizers in the 90s.

The reason they're terrible is that they insist that every item either has a *time* or be an "all day event".  I just want to put an item on a calendar like I would with a regular paper calendar.

So, I made this, which is literally just adding items to days.

It's CLI, but it works fine in Termux on Android.

`make release` will build it in termux.
