# Simple Planner

Initial commit.  Actual description will come later.

Some miscellaneous notes about this project:

* This is my first C project that's not just an exercise.  (Yay!)  So some stuff probably stinks.
* I know that I should write some kind of configure script, using something called Autoconf.  I will do that in future projects, but at the moment I really want to get *some* kind of C project done.
* Similarly, there are no "proper" unit test, at least not yet.  I'll probably make some rudimentary unit tests that don't use an actual framework.
* And I'm mostly using PHP documentation standards.  It's just what I know.
* I'm sure my makefile is horrible.  I don't want to take the time right now to figure out how to do it the right way.
* This uses SQLite, so Ubuntu/Debian users (like me) need to install `libsqlite3-dev`.  Termux thankfully already has it preinstalled.
